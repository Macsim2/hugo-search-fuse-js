This is not a standalone theme. This is a Hugo theme component.

To use this:

1. Clone this repo to ~your-site/themes/hugo-search-fuse-js~ directory.
2. Add "hugo-search-fuse-js" as the left-most element of the ~theme~ list variable
   in your site's or theme's ~config.toml~. Example:
   #+begin_example
   theme = ["hugo-search-fuse-js", "my-theme"]
   #+end_example
3. Create ~content/search.md~ with ~layout~ parameter set to
   ~"search"~, and ~output~ parameter set to ~["html", "json"]~. The
   content or body of this ~search.md~ is not used by the
   ~search.html~ template that's part of this theme component.

   Here is an example ~search.md~:
   #+begin_src md
   +++
   title = "Search"
   layout = "search"
   outputs = ["html", "json"]
   [sitemap]
     priority = 0.1
   +++
   #+end_src
